- How to implement gRPC Authentication?

  Credentials can be of two types:

  **Channel credentials**, which are attached to a Channel, such as Client SSL credentials.
  **Call credentials**, which are attached to a call (such as JWT token).

    ```java
    pool, _ := x509.SystemCertPool()
    // error handling omitted
    creds := credentials.NewClientTLSFromCert(pool, "")
    perRPC, _ := oauth.NewServiceAccountFromFile("service-account.json", scope)
    conn, _ := grpc.Dial(
        "greeter.googleapis.com",
        grpc.WithTransportCredentials(creds),
        grpc.WithPerRPCCredentials(perRPC),
    )
    // error handling omitted
    client := pb.NewGreeterClient(conn)
    // ...
    ```
